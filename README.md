# Command Execution Vulnerability in `OpenAI Baselines`

A command execution vulnerability exists in the `OpenAI Baselines` project version `master`.


[`OpenAI Baselines`](https://github.com/openai/baselines) is a set of high-quality implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.

The code in line `30` of the `baselines/deepq/deepq.py` file in this project uses the `load_act` staticmethod function to load an external file, which does not validate the legitimate content of the external file, leading to the creation of a vulnerability that can be exploited by loading a maliciously constructed file and thus achieving command execution.

**I believe this vulnerability exists in other operating systems and Python versions as well.**

I used [commands](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/ea25b9e8b234e6ee1bca43083f8f3cf974143998/baselines/deepq/README.md#if-you-are-curious) from the project repository to reach command execution via a maliciously constructed data file.

I have uploaded the reproduction video to this repository along with the malicious file(`cartpole_model_evil.pkl`) page.
